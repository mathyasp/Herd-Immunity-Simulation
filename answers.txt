What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)

    - Population size: 100,000
    - Percent vaccinated: 45%
    - Virus Name: Covid
    - Mortality Rate: 0.2
    - Reproductive Rate: 0.6
    - People Initially Infected: 100

What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?

    - Percentage Infected: 10.98%

What percentage of the population died from the virus?

    - Percentage That Died: 11.59%

Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?

    - Total Vaccine Saves: 45,148
